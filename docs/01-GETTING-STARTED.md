# Getting Started with Quill

Welcome to Quill! This guide will walk you through installation and running your first program.

## What is Quill?

Quill is a statically-typed programming language designed for **fast, numeric computing**. It compiles directly to native machine code via C, giving you performance close to C while maintaining a clean, readable syntax.

### Key Features

- **Built for Math & Numerics** — First-class `number`, `double`, and `char` types with a math-oriented standard library
- **Blazing Fast** — Compiles to native machine code with near-C performance
- **Statically Typed** — Type errors caught at compile time
- **Simple & Clean Syntax** — Readable code with optional semicolons and minimal boilerplate
- **Cross-Platform** — Native support for Linux and Windows
- **C Interop** — Call C libraries directly or drop into raw C when needed

## Installation

### Windows

1. Download `quill-windows32.exe` or `quill-windows64.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/omo5454/Quill/releases) page
2. Run the executable in PowerShell

### Linux

1. Download `quill-linux` from the [Releases](https://github.com/omo5454/Quill/releases) page
2. Make it executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x quill-linux
./quill-linux myfile.qsc
```

### macOS

macOS support is currently paused. The focus is on ensuring maximum stability on Linux and Windows.

## Your First Program

Create a file named `hello.qsc`:

```quill
say "Hello, Quill!";
```

Compile and run it:

```bash
./quill-linux --compile hello.qsc
./hello
```

Or in one step with the `-o` flag to specify output:

```bash
./quill-linux --compile hello.qsc -o hello_binary
./hello_binary
```

## Usage

### Compiling to a Native Binary

Transpile to C and compile to an executable:

```bash
quill-[os] --compile myfile.qsc
```

This generates a C file and compiles it to a binary with the same name (minus `.qsc`).

### Transpiling to C Only

Generate C code without compiling:

```bash
quill-[os] myfile.qsc -o output.c
```

This is useful if you want to inspect the generated C or compile with custom C flags.

### Output File Naming

By default, the output name matches the input (e.g., `program.qsc` → `program.c` or `program`). Use `-o` to specify a custom name:

```bash
quill-[os] myfile.qsc -o my_output
```
